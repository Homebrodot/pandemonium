	<description>
		Using this class, a small self contained multi page article can be created. 
		It will load every file from a folder ([code]articles_folder[/code]) in alpahbetical order, parse them as markdown, and create a paginated page from every single one of them. Additionally it will also serve a folder if it's [code]serve_folder[/code] property points to an existing folder. These can be accessed at [code]...articles_url/files/[/code]. If [code]serve_folder_relative[/code] is true (default), then this folder is relative to the [code]articles_folder[/code]. This makes it possible to serve images, videos, custom css, javascript, etc. for a PagedArticle, while all of the article's data can reside in one folder.
		If it finds a summary.md, it will serve it as the root, else it will generate one.
		The links is generates currently look like: [code]/01_test.md[/code]
		As an example let's take this folder:
		[code]article/
		-- article_files/
		---- test.jpg
		-- page1.md
		-- page2.md
		-- summary.md[/code]
		A [PagedArticleWebPage] is pointed to the [code]article[/code] folder, it's [code]serve_folder[/code] property is set to [code]article_files[/code], and is accesible at [code]http://127.0.0.1/test_article[/code]:
		[code]Opening: http://127.0.0.1/test_article will send summary.md rendered as html.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/test_article/page1.md will send page1.md rendered as html.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/test_article/page2.md will send page2.md rendered as html.
		Opening: http://127.0.0.1/test_article/files/test.jpg will send test.jpg.[/code]
