# Pandemonium Engine TODOs

# WFC module

- Need to rework the readme. Also link to the sample repo. (https://github.com/Relintai/wfc_module_samples)
- TilingWaveFormCollapse should not generate the images themeslves, rather it should just use internal ids, and return those to you. It could store variants. -> a derived class chould be mamde that adds image generation on top, but in a friendlier way.
- All class variables should be previxed with "_".
- Array2D and 3D's getters and setters that need coordinates use a reversed order compared to everything in the engine. This is super dangerous, and should be changed. (Currently: get(y, x). Should be get(x, y)).
- The classes need smaller fixes and touchups.
- There are probably a few lingering bugs, as some examples give bad results.
- Need to make sure wave size, out size, and size related things are consistent, and intuitive, as right now they are neither.
- The bindings will likely need more improvements.
- Would be nice, if the algorithm could be parametrized from gdscript aswell.
- Maybe addding Array2D, and Array3D like classes to the engine would be a good idea.
